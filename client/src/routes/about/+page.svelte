    <p>
        CommunityPower is a platform that connects electric vehicle owners with
        charging stations.
    </p>
    <p>
        We aim to make it easier for electric vehicle owners to find charging
        stations to encourage the use of sustainable transport. We also aim to
        make it easier for charging station owners to share their charging
        stations with the community, particularly during times when their solar
        panels are generating excess electricity.
    </p>
    <p>
        CommunityPower is an inclusive space meant for everyone. Please be clear
        and polite when communicating with others, and keep engagements positive
        and constructive. We ask that users ensure they keep their bookings and
        make use of our rating features to help others in the community.
